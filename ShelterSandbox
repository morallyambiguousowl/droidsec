Shelter Setup (Sandbox/Isolation)
Install any mainstream applications that could be suspected of calling home/filesystem scanning inside
the work profile sandbox
Applications may include: Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Chrome, Tinder

Delete unncessesary applications: 
If you are not separating different profiles or utilizing the apps for more than one account,
delete the application from the personal profile.

AFWall+ requires root permissions, and it only reaches the personal profile; the sandbox remains untouched.
Firewalls that do not require root permission on Android typically route your traffic similar
to a VPN (without going to a remote server). This can disrupt an actual VPN running on your device. 
To be able to run AFWall+/VPN of your choosing in personal profile, and a firewall in the sandboxed work profile,
you can utilize Netguard inside Shelter. Netguard is an implementation that blocks, logs, and notifies the user
if an application sends any internet traffic.
Clone the app "Netguard" to the Work profile.
Disable any applications that do not require internet access. 

Recap: This will allow your device to route traffic through your VPN, and simultaneously have a running firewall
on both the personal and sandboxed (isolated) profile.
