#Android Security & Privacy Measures
#Goes without saying that this will differ on your threat model and the ROM you are running

1) If you are using Gapps,disable any unnecessary services by holding down the application icon
    -If uninstall is not an option, click disable and remove permissions
    -If you are on stock ROM, replace Gboard with AnySoftKeyboard (F-Droid)
        If you keep gboard, settings to optimize privacy will be listed in System Settings instructions
    
2) Install the following applications:
    F-Droid from https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk
    On F-Droid:
      Shelter (Sandbox/isolation)
      AFWall+ (firewall) (root)
      PilferShush (Mic blocker) 
      Scrambled Exif (photo metadata remover)
      Simple Contacts (Disable Google Contacts)
      Simple Gallery (Disable Google Gallery)
      Simple Calendar (Disable Google Calendar)
      OsmAnd+ (Disable Google Maps)
    From Google Play Store (or any other apk mirrors)
      App Ops (permissions audit) (root)
      Signal (encrypted coms)
      ProtonVPN (or any other prem VPN)
      Xposed modules & xprivacylua (root) (must be a supported device)
      
3) Auditing Services
   Have all unnecessary services disabled (google sync, printer spool, NFC, etc)
   Open the shelter app
      Clone all applications suspected of embedded tracking to the Shelter (Gapp services may break)
      Delete those cloned applications in personal profile
   Open AFWall+
      Select "block selected"
      Select every application not vital to necessary services
   Open App Ops
      Audit application permissions thoroughly
   PilferShush
      Set to passive mode
   Signal
      Set to default messenger
      Use of a VoIP (Gvoice or mysudo is optional)
