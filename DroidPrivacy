#Android Security & Privacy Measures
#Goes without saying that this will differ on your threat model and the ROM you are running

1) If you are using Gapps,disable any unnecessary services by holding down the application icon
    -If uninstall is not an option, click disable and remove permissions
    -If you are on stock ROM, replace Gboard with AnySoftKeyboard (F-Droid)
    
2) Install the following applications:
    F-Droid from https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk
    On F-Droid:
      Shelter (Sandbox/isolation)
      AFWall+ (firewall) (root)
      Scrambled Exif (photo metadata remover)
