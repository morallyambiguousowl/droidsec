For the rooted user, I recommend the use of AFWall on the non-sandboxxed profile.
This file is going to key in on what system services that you can safely prevent from contacting the internet. 

Open AFWall | Preferences
Logging
  Turn on Log Service
Security
  Enable protection (set passcode/pattern)
Rules / Connectivity
  Active rules - Check
  LAN control - Check
  VPN control - Check (This must be selected so you can audit which applications can reach the internet over VPN connections)
  
System Services/Frameworks that you can filter without error:
  Android Debug Bridge
  Digital Rights Management service
  GPS
  Linux Kernel
  Linux shell
  Android Accessibility Suite
  Android Setup
  Android System Webview
  Bluetooth
  Calculator
  Calendar
  Calendar Storage
  Camera
  Captive PortalLogin
  Clock
  Contacts
  Intent Filter Verification Service
  Market Feedback Agent
  Mobile Installer
  MusicFX
  Nfc Service
  Photos
  Print Service
  ProxyHandler
  Sprint OMA-DM
  System UI
  
  These services are all being packet filtered and logged. My phone has complete functionality and reduces how many times
  the device calls home. These are all I have tested so far. More to come.
